        <h1>Internship Program</h1>
        <h2>Studio Internships</h2>
        <p>
          The Clay Studio of Missoula offers several studio technician internships for qualified 
          individuals.  Applicants must be self-motivated and have background experience in the field 
          of ceramics.  As there is no set application deadline, interested individuals are encouraged 
          to apply at any time during the given year. All positions are filled on an as needed basis. 
          In exchange for five hours per week of service, interns receive access to the community studio 
          space as well as storage area for their work. 
        </p>
           
        <p>
          Studio technician interns at the Clay Studio of Missoula can expect to engage in a wide variety 
          of tasks, including (but not limited to):

        </ul>
        <p>
            While the Clay Studio of Missoula routinely offers studio technician internship positions, 
            we at times do have internships in the fields grant writing, gallery assistance, fundraising 
            event assistance, and web/graphic design on an as needed basis. Individuals with background 
            experience in any of the fields listed above are encouraged to inquire to studio staff about 
            potentially designing a new internship position.

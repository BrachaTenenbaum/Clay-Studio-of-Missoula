        <h1>Internship Program</h1>
        <p>Studio Internships
          The Clay Studio of Missoula offers several studio technician internships for qualified individuals.  Applicants must be self-motivated and have background experience in the field of ceramics.  As there is no set application deadline, interested individuals are encouraged to apply at any time during the given year. All positions are filled on an as needed basis. In exchange for five hours per week of service, interns receive access to the community studio space as well as storage area for their work. 
           
          Studio technician interns at the Clay Studio of Missoula can expect to engage in a wide variety of tasks, including (but not limited to):
          
          •Mixing clay and/or glazes
          •Creating ceramic test tiles
          •General studio maintenance/cleaning (i.e. mopping, dusting)
          •Assisting the firing of the wood kiln
          •Loading and firing kilns
          •Helping children's class instructors
          •Aiding preparations for special events/fundraisers
          
          While the Clay Studio of Missoula routinely offers studio technician internship positions, we at times do have internships in the fields grant writing, gallery assistance, fundraising event assistance, and web/graphic design on an as needed basis. Individuals with background experience in any of the fields listed above are encouraged to inquire to studio staff about potentially designing a new internship position.
           
          Outreach Internships
          Outreach Internships are available seasonally (late Spring-Summer). Outreach interns assist with numerous outreach events and preparations for activities. The deadline for application is May 1st of each year. Qualified applicants who apply earlier may receive priority consideration.
           
          Tasks include:
          Act as an ambassador for the Clay Studio of Missoula at events in the community by distributing promotional materials and leading clay activities. 
          Set-up and take down the Clay Studio Booth at scheduled activities.
          Help to develop and initiate new ways for the Clay Studio of Missoula to share the fun of clay arts at the festivals and events we participate in each year.
          Work with the Outreach Coordinator to develop our presence at events aimed at engaging portions of the Missoula community that are currently underrepresented within the Clay Studio of Missoula’s community.

          </p>
          <p>Students will have the chance to work on projects independently in
              and outside of class and learn how to make forms that work effectively
            with raku, horsehair, and naked raku. The first class will involve an
            introduction to making works specifically for the raku kiln, which will
            be continued to be made and fired during the following sessions as work
            is completed and bisqued.

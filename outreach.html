          <h1>RAKU - new 5 week class starts 10/17</h1>
          <p>
              Some experience in ceramics is helpful, but not required<br>
              Tuesday afternoons: October 17-November 14, 1-4pm (10 weeks)<br>
              Instructor: Dudley Anderson<br>
              $140 for members / $150 for non-members<br>
          </p>
          <p>Students will have the chance to work on projects independently in
              and outside of class and learn how to make forms that work effectively
            with raku, horsehair, and naked raku. The first class will involve an
            introduction to making works specifically for the raku kiln, which will
            be continued to be made and fired during the following sessions as work
            is completed and bisqued.

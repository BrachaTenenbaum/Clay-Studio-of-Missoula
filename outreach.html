        <h1>Outreach Partnerships</h1>
        <p>
          The Clay Studio of Missoula offers community programming throughout the year 
          to increase art access for all.  This includes monthly gallery openings, a 
          free-of-charge activities booth for clay exploration at local events, seasonal 
          open house events, and partnerships with local organizations, schools, 
          and programs, including The Flagship Program, The Missoula Food Bank, and SPARK! 
          Arts Ignite Learning.  <a href="./private-lessons">Tours</a> of the studio facility are 
          also available to anyone curious about clay.

        <h2>Flagship, Claymania!</h2>
        <p>
          The Flagship Program provides afterschool opportunities for students 
           in eight Missoula County Public Schools in grades K-12. Under the umbrella of 
           Western Montana Mental Health Center, Flagship offers students a school-based program 
           in mentoring and skill building.  Flagship is free of charge to all participants and 
           families. Since 2012, The Clay Studio of Missoula has served Lowell Elementary School’s 
           Flagship after-school program students with ongoing weekly classes for grades K-5.  
           These Claymania! sessions provide a needed opportunity for children with little arts 
           education available during school hours.  For many parents, these sessions also provide 
           activities for their children during the time between school dismissal and the completion 
           of a 9-5 work shift.

        <h2>Missoula Food Bank, Empty Bowls Full Souls Fundraiser</h2>
        <p>
          The Clay Studio of Missoula assists with The Missoula Food Bank’s annual 
          “Empty Bowls, Full Souls” fundraiser.  Guests to the fundraising dinner choose a 
          handmade bowl with which to eat a simple meal together.  The purpose is to raise awareness 
          on food insecurity in our community.  The Clay Studio hosts free bowl making and glazing 
          activities ahead of this event. Over 150 bowls are handcrafted and donated every year by 
          Clay Studio of Missoula artists and the local clay community.
         </p>
        <h2>SPARK! Arts Ignite Learning, Teaching Organization</h2>
        <p>
          SPARK! is a community wide partnership working to expand arts programming in 
          Missoula County Public Schools. We facilitate and foster connections between district 
          schools, local arts organizations, and teaching artists helping to ensure access to the 
          arts for all Missoula County Public School students. The Clay Studio of Missoula is a 
          teaching organization that is available to collaborate with classroom teachers to integrate 
          arts into their curriculum.
